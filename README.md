# 🐀 Sewerage Search: Descend Into Madness  

A 2D vertical platformer made for the **SFU Mountain Madness 2025**.  
Descend deeper into the sewers to find the cat where rats get bigger, the art gets stranger,  
and the game drives the player into madness.

## 🎮 Gameplay  

- **Movement** → Run and jump across platforms with gravity mechanics.  
- **Enemies** → Rats patrol back and forth.  
- **Health System** → Start with 3 hearts; collisions reduce health.  
- **Scrolling** → The screen scrolls downward as the player descends.  
- **No True Ending** → Finding the cat still kills you, reinforcing the theme of madness.

## ✨ Inspiration  

Inspired by **Louis Wain**, the English artist famous for cat illustrations.  

- His work became more abstract and chaotic as he developed schizophrenia.  
- We mirrored this by making imagery stranger and rats bigger as the game progresses.  
- The goal: capture a **descent into chaos and frustration** through gameplay and visuals.
